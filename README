Part 1- solving sudoku game.
Part 2- solving the problem k_subset in 3 different variation.

==================
=  Description: =
==================
Part 1:
the first 4 function: check_row, check_column, check_square, is_empty, checks if a num can be
    placed in the given cell, the function illegal_placement operates this functions into 1 function
    that returns True or False whether the placement of the number is legal or not.
fill_sudoku_col- A function that fills the sudoku board using recursion, it receives a
    number and a game board and fills the number according to the game rules
    moving threw columns and rows.
solve_sudoku_help- A function that operates the function- 'fill_sudoku_col' each time on a
    different number using recursion.
solve_sudoku- A function that receives a sudoku board and solves the game, if the game
    can be solved it will return True otherwise it will return False

Part 2:
In all the questions i used the function- bad_input - A function that checks the inputs and returns a
result suitable according to the demands.

Question 1-
    print_k_subsets- A function that receives 2 numbers- n,k and prints all the subsets from
    0 to n-1 by length k.
    I used the functions:
        k_subset_helper- A function that receives a list, and 3 numbers-k, index, picked, and
        recursively go through the numbers and operates the function print_set
        print_set- A function that receives a list filled with True and False and prints a
        list of all the indexes that had a True value
Question 2-
    fill_k_subsets- A function that receives 2 numbers- n,k and fills a list with all the
    subsets from 0 to n-1 by length k.
    I used the functions:
        k_subset_helper_lst- A function that receives 2 lists- cur_set and lst, and 3 numbers-k,
        index, picked, and recursively go through the numbers and operates the
        function print_set
        print_set_lst- A function that receives a list filled with True and False and another
        list and adds to the list lists of all the indexes that had a True value
Question 3:
    return_k_subsets- A function that receives 2 numbers- n,k and returns a list with all the
    subsets from 0 to n-1 by length k.
    I used the function:
        k_subset_helper_return- A function that builds sub lists in recursion and returns a list
        of all sub lists.
